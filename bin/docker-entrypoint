# NOTE: Enable this as you need to get migrations working in your deployed

# the Dockerfile CMD. I use puma in the production.Dockerfile as that's the
# recommended option by the Puma team (https://github.com/puma/puma#rails), but
# the default Rails Dockerfile uses `./bin/rails server`

# echo "${2}"
